    "### Introduction\n",
    "Coffee is one of the most important drinks humanity could have ever discovered and yet I feel it is also one of the more underappreciated things in regards to the broader population. After watching a bunch of tiktok and youtube short content creators attest to how much \"better-tasting\" coffee could be, I decided to take a leap of faith and try it at home for myself. And oh boy was this a rabbit hole that I never thought I would enjoy immensely or go down into.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, I was immediately able to taste the difference, flavors being quite smooth, non-bitter, and fruity after dialing in the right grind size. It was absolutely mind bending, \"how could coffee taste this good!\". However, I had a really hard time distinguishing the actual flavor profiles mentioned due to lack of tasting experience. Over time I was able to slowly differentiate some of the flavors (not all) and have been brewing coffee ever since my first buy (5 months to date). But there was always a thought in the back of my mind telling me to question \"what more can you do to brew a better cup?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "This question led me to confronting the most obvious factor in the entire process of making coffee \"the origin\" or for a better term \"sourcing\". Even though I am still a beginner in the space, it is a widely known that growing and processing methods at these coffee farms affect the outcome of the taste as well as the quality. However after some light digging, I was left with some unsatisfaction. Most of the articles put out there are very obscure or don't explain too much on how these factors come into play, or it felt like complete pseudoscience at times. \n",
    "\n",
    "To combat this I decided to take matters into my own hand and try and model something for myself to nail down what factors actually contribute to a good tasting cup of coffee. I told myself - \"Welp, I am in a data science program after all, why not apply the skills I have learned so far and take a stab at it.\" Never have I ever once thought that I would be applying skills I have learned in my career path in this personal of a manner. Damn it! It's just a hobby bro.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we delve deeper into how I acquire and process the data here's some quick info on gear for those that are interested!"

    "### Extra Crucial Information Before Starting\n",
    "\n",
    "With the two stated questions above we need to dive into the details a little bit about what contributes to coffee scoring in this dataset so we don't become redundant or mess up our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was noted in the dataset itself that total.cup.points being the scoring system is the sum of scorings on 10 attributes across 5 cups of the same coffee.\n",
    "These Attributes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Aroma - scent or fragrance\n",
    "2. Flavor - how well developed are the flavor notes present\n",
    "3. Aftertaste - length of flavor once coffee has been swallowed, the longer the better scoring\n",
    "4. Acidity - based on acidity scale, some coffees are expected to be more acidic, but in general the lower the better\n",
    "5. Body - this is what is known as mouthfeel, 5 cups of the same coffee are graded on consistency of this feel\n",
    "6. Balance - combination of (acidity, aroma, flavor, and aftertaste) the more they strike an equilibrium the higher the score\n",
    "7. Sweetness - what is considered a balanced level of sweetness\n",
    "8. Clean Cup - a derivation of uniformity from first sip to aftertaste\n",
    "9. Uniformity - consistency of the uniformity of flavors among 5 of the same cups\n",
    "10. Overall - Personal considerations and rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defects can set back the score 2-4 points during the cupping / tasting process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Scoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "- 90 - 100 is outstanding\n",
    "- 85 - 89.99 is excellent\n",
    "- 80 - 84.99 is very good\n",
    "- < 80  is below specialty coffee\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring Information: [Break Down of Coffee Scores](https://spiritanimalcoffee.com/blogs/spirit-animal-blog/the-coffee-quality-score)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes on Scoring Process**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I have not tried many specialty coffees out yet, what I consider good may not be on par with how the SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America) thinks. Nor do I score my own at home cups in such a manner, because who really does that on a regular basis or at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this criteria I would like you the reader to keep in mind, the coffees I will be aiming for in our end result of *finding specific regions* will most likely have a threshold of what was shown 80+ to gauruntee specialty coffee standard, but if the results are quite limiting, I may expand the range to 65+ points.\n"

Others such as altitude have other variable counter parts, in this particular case 3 defining (low, high, mean) in the above section. Dated variables such as harvest year will be used but others that provide a pure date may be a little too continuous to categorize. To account for a possible seasonal element I may go with seperating grading date into year and months as well as performing a calculation on grading date - Expiration to provide a more useful metric days to expiration. All the other variables seem reasonable and can be categorized easily through Label Encoding, I will probably be using the sklearn.preprocessing LabelEncoder feature.\n",
